The objective is to create a program that will allow a user to add an employee to a given department.  The department in this case is Advertising.  A user can input employee information including name, phone number, email address, and salary.

####Giving Raises

This program also allows the user to add a review to the employee variable.  This review can be automatically parsed using regex.  The user can then determine an employee's eligibility for a department-wide raise based on the results of the review.
